## Installing

The easiest way to install the extension is to go to [extensions.gnome.org].

However, review process on [extensions.gnome.org] is kinda slow, so a new
release may be available here on GitHub, but not on [extensions.gnome.org] yet.

If you want to install from GitHub: see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)
